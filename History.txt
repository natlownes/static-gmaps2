=== 0.0.5 / 2010-02-14 by nat.lownes@gmail.com
* Updated most all of the Ruby API to match the most recent Google Static Maps API.  This includes:
	- Changed the maximum_url_size to 2048
	- Changing parameters to match their Google API equivalents. i.e.:
		- Marker's "alpha_character" can be used simply as :label / Marker#label=
		- Changed available colors restrictions
		- Updated marker label restriction to capital letters A-Z, 0-9
		- Added required sensor parameter to Map
		- Remove requiring a Google Maps API key.  It can still be used via the original :key parameter.
	- Updated Marker to accept:
		- color
		- label
		- icon
		- size
		- shadow
* Changed MissingArgument instances to ArgumentError instances
* Added address support on both Map :center and Marker :location params/setters via a StaticGmaps::Location class.
* Added block initializer support if you cannot wield a lengthy hash like a weapon.
* All of these changes maintain backward compatibility with previous versions.

=== 0.0.4 / 2009-02-18 by daniel.mattes@gmx.de

* No Map::default_center, because of auto centering through google when markers.count > 1
* If no option[:markers] are given, they will be set to []. Otherwise the constant markers array will grow to unlimited.
* Setting constants like geokit do it.
  In initializers you can overwrite it like
  StaticGmaps::default_size = [ 170, 200 ]
* Now on http://github.com/dmattes/static-gmaps/
